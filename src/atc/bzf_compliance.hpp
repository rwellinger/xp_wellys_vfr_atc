// BZF-Strict-Mode pilot-utterance conformance checker for the DE/BZF
// profile. Implements NfL Sprechfunk 2024 §25 b) Nr. 1 readback
// obligations: a pilot must read back the safety-relevant items of a
// tower clearance (runway, QNH, frequency, SSR code, etc.). When this
// module reports a missing element, the state machine sends a
// corrective tower response (atc_templates.json :: bzf_strict.*)
// instead of silently absorbing the readback.
//
// SDK-free. Lives in xp_atc_engine OBJECT lib so atc_repl and tests can
// use it directly. Operates on raw (pre-normalize_for_speech) text:
// tower templates contain "QNH {qnh}" / "Piste {runway}", and the
// pilot transcript has already been reverse-normalised by
// de_phraseology::parse_spoken_number(), so both sides speak the same
// digit form when this check runs.
namespace bzf_compliance {

// Safety-relevant readback elements from NfL §25 b) Nr. 1. The enum
// values map 1:1 to keys in atc_templates.json :: bzf_strict (e.g.
// Element::QNH -> "missing_qnh").
enum class Element {

// Structured snapshot of a readback-demanding tower clearance. Built at

// transmission actually obligated the pilot to read back — a fixed
// phraseological table per clearance type, gated by what was issued
// (e.g. QNH only when the controller passed it, not when it came from
