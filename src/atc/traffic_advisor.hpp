 * Phase-2 traffic advisor. SDK-free pure-function evaluator that
 * decides whether — and which — traffic target deserves a controller-
 * issued advisory on this tick. engine::poll_traffic_advisory drives
 * the evaluator each frame and renders the text via
 * atc_state_machine::render_traffic_advisory(); traffic_dialog tracks
 * the pilot-acknowledgement side-channel.
 *
 * Trigger logic is fully deterministic:
 *   - ATC contact established (atc_state != IDLE AND user is on a
 *     TOWER/GROUND/APPROACH freq).
 *   - A target T satisfies all of:
 *       2.0 <= distance_nm <= 8.0
 *       |altitude_diff| <= 1500 ft
 *       T in user's forward arc (clock 9-12 or 12-3, i.e. {9,10,11,12,1,2,3})
 *       Closure rate positive OR target track perpendicular to user
 *       T not advised in the last 60 s (per modeS_id)
 *   - Cooldown: at most one global advisory every 20 s.
 *
 * The evaluator is pure: callers own AdvisoryHistory and update it
 * after dispatch.
