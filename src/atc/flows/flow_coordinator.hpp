// Coordinator scaffolding for the A1 flow-split refactor. Step 2
// introduces the data shapes; step 4 wires them up to actual per-flow
// implementations. Today these types are derived from
// atc_state_machine's state_ + departure_type_, so they read like a
// thin view over the existing state machine. Once PatternFlow and
// CrossCountryFlow own their own state in step 4, the derivation
// flips: the coordinator becomes authoritative and the legacy flag
// disappears.

//                 GROUND_CONTACT, TAXI_CLEARED, TOWER_CONTACT, UNICOM_ACTIVE)
//                 OR airborne but with no active departure
//                 (EN_ROUTE, APPROACH_CONTACT — these transition out
//                 of the XC flow in step 4).
