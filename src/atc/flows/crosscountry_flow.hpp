// Cross-country flow. Step 4 of the A1 flow-split refactor introduces
// the disjoint enum that mirrors the XC-side ATCState entries and
// hosts the XC-specific airport-change logic that used to live in
// atc_state_machine.cpp.
//
// Today the enum mirrors the three XC-side ATCState values 1:1 — once
// the facade is gone (step 5), this becomes the canonical type. The
// qualified state strings ("XC/EN_ROUTE" etc.) are produced
// exclusively by state_name(State) below.

// by CrossCountryFlow because EN_ROUTE is the only state this
// triggers from. The reset clears readback_pending, assigned_runway,
