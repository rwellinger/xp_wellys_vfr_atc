 * Phase-2 traffic dialog. SDK-free side-channel that runs *parallel* to
 * the main ATCState flow:
 *   - The per-tick traffic_advisor decides whether to issue a callout.
 *   - traffic_dialog::on_advisory_emitted() flips state to AWAITING_ACK
 *     and stashes the target's modeS_id.
 *   - The next pilot transcript is dispatched first to traffic_dialog;
 *     if it matches a TRAFFIC_* intent, traffic_dialog renders the
 *     acknowledgement (and a possible re-issue with refreshed geometry)
 *     and returns to IDLE. The ATC main flow (PATTERN_ENTRY,
 *     TOWER_CONTACT, ...) is never touched.
 *
 * Lives in xp_atc_engine OBJECT lib — no XPLM headers, the headless
 * atc_repl tool drives the same path the plugin does.
