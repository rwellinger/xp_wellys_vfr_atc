// "Sagen Sie nochmal" / "Wiederholen Sie" and the REQUEST_REPEAT
// pipeline takes over from there. ~350 ms total: pink noise that
// briefly modulates plus a short squelch click at the tail. Generated
// in-process (std::mt19937 + a one-pole low-pass) — no WAV asset, no
// network, so it cannot fail in the same way the upstream TTS just
// did. Respects settings::volume().
