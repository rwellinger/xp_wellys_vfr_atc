 * Windows build gate (issue #18). The macOS AVFoundation permission
 * flow lives in mic_permission.mm, which the Windows build excludes.
 * Windows has no per-application microphone authorization dialog
 * comparable to macOS TCC, so access is reported as granted here. If
 * the system-wide "Microphone access" privacy toggle is off, capture
 * simply yields silence — surfacing that to the user is part of the
 * mic-capture port (issue #21) / UI helpers (issue #22).
