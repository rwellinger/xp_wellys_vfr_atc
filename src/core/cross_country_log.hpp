// Per-transmission failure logging + per-flight logbook for the
// cross-country measurement session. PURELY OBSERVATIONAL — this module
// never feeds matching, routing or classification. It records every
// processed pilot transmission so the raw material to decide whether a
// phraseology fuzzy-layer or a location-aware proper-name recogniser is
// needed can be evaluated offline, while doubling as an ATC-side flight
// logbook. Each record pairs the pilot transmission with the controller
// reply it produced (atc_response), so clearances and the readbacks that
// answer them read as a complete exchange.
//
// One valid, pretty-printed JSON document per flight is written to
// <dir>/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM_<AIRPORT>.json. The whole document is rewritten
// (atomically, temp file + rename) after every transmission, so it is
// always a complete, well-formed file with an up-to-date summary — no
// "flight finished" event is required. Flights are split by a logging-
// only heuristic (airborne -> back on the ground + IDLE = new departure)
// or forced via begin_new_flight().
//
// SDK-free. Lives in the xp_atc_engine OBJECT lib (file I/O only, no
// XPLM headers) so atc_repl and the scenario tests can exercise it too.
