// Phase 3/4 traffic-phase classifier. SDK-free, provider-agnostic,

// flight_phase detector: traffic targets see only their own
// alt_agl / groundspeed / vertical_speed plus the phase we
// classified them as on the previous tick.
//
// Phase 4 adds the Pattern/Final branches: for targets in the vicinity
// of the user's destination airport (≤ 8 NM, < 3000 ft AGL), geometric
// alignment with the active-runway heading + airport pattern direction
// promotes them to Final or Pattern. Climb/Cruise/Descend stay Unknown
// for now — they don't drive sequencing or advisories.
